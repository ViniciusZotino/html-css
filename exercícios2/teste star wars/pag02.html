            <p id="aphroso">Chelli Lona Aphra was a human female born in the year 24 BBY to Korin and Lona Aphra — her father and mother, respectively. The Aphras retained a house in the University Quarter on the Second Moon of Thrinittik, a peaceful world free from the strife that had broken out across the galaxy during the Separatist Crisis and the Clone Wars. Young Chelli — known affectionately as "Little Boop" to her mother and father — often observed the latter's work as a dedicated scholar. <br>She absorbed information as he spoke about subjects, such as the extinct Massassi species and their Massassi piece crystals. Korin specialized in researching the ancient Ordu Aspectu, a nearly-forgotten splinter group of the Jedi Order that disappeared with little trace millennia before Chelli's birth during the Republic Era.</br></p>
